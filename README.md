# TELCO-CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION

## OVERVIEW
IN THIS PROJECT , YOU WILL FIND THE ANALYIS OF TELCO CHURN DATASET AND ALSO THE DATA MODELING FOR PREDICTION OF THE CUSTOMERS CHURN.

SO IN THIS PROJECT WE HAVE DONE ALL THE FOLLOWING TASKS : 

# 1.Data Understanding & Preprocessing
   
Load the dataset and inspect its structure.

Convert TotalCharges from object to numeric.

Check and handle missing values.

Encode categorical variables:

Label encoding for binary columns.

One-hot encoding for multi-category columns.

Scale numerical features: tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.

# 2. SOME ANALYSIS OF THE DATASET....... ## Explore the distribution of Churn.

Bivariate Analysis:

Compare churn rates across Contract types.

Explore churn based on tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.

Investigate churn patterns related to SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, and MultipleLines

Churn Analysis:

Examine churn across key columns like Contract, PaymentMethod, InternetService, and tenure.
# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA REPORT
# 4. Modeling

Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80:20 ratio).

Train classification models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluate models using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
